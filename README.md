# LIBRARY-ESP32-DEVKIT
This repository contains a library of the ESP32 DEVKIT for Proteus software. The library includes:

-Package for PCB design: Accurate and detailed components for designing printed circuit boards with the ESP32 DEVKIT.
-Schematic diagram library: Elements for creating clear and functional electrical schematics.
-3D visualization: Three-dimensional models of the ESP32 DEVKIT for precise visualization in design projects (Note: the 3D design was not created by me, it was created by Gerry Stenz and can be found [here](https://grabcad.com/library/esp32-dev-kit-v1-1)).

This library is intended to simplify and streamline the design of projects using the ESP32 DEVKIT, providing complete and precise tools for every stage of development. Note: This library does not include the connection between programming the ESP32 in the Arduino IDE and Proteus.
